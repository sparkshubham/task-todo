Here’s a sample `README.md` file for your project that includes instructions for pulling code from both frontend and backend branches, installing dependencies, creating the database, and running the application:

---

# Task Management Application

## Overview

This is a task management application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with MySQL as the database. The application allows you to create, read, update, and delete tasks.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. **Clone the Repositories**

First, clone the frontend and backend repositories if you haven’t already.

```bash
# Clone the backend repository
git clone <backend-repository-url>
cd backend
git checkout <backend-branch-name>

# Clone the frontend repository
git clone <frontend-repository-url>
cd frontend
git checkout <frontend-branch-name>
```

### 2. **Pull the Latest Changes**

Navigate to each directory and pull the latest changes from the remote repositories.

```bash
# Pull changes in the backend directory
cd path/to/backend
git pull origin <backend-branch-name>

# Pull changes in the frontend directory
cd path/to/frontend
git pull origin <frontend-branch-name>
```

### 3. **Install Dependencies**

Install the required Node.js packages for both frontend and backend.

```bash
# Install dependencies for the backend
cd path/to/backend
npm install

# Install dependencies for the frontend
cd path/to/frontend
npm install
```

### 4. **Create the Database**

You need to create the MySQL database and table. Open your MySQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, command line) and execute the following SQL commands:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE task_db;
USE task_db;

CREATE TABLE tasks (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT
);
```

### 5. **Run the Application**

Run both the frontend and backend servers.

```bash
# Start the backend server
cd path/to/backend
npm start

# Open a new terminal and start the frontend server
cd path/to/frontend
npm start
```

### 6. **Access the Application**

Once both servers are running, you can access the application in your browser at:

- **Frontend**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **Backend API**: `http://localhost:5000/api/tasks`

### Troubleshooting

- Ensure both servers are running on different ports (default ports are 3000 for frontend and 5000 for backend).
- Check the terminal output for any errors and resolve them accordingly.
- Make sure MySQL is running and accessible.
